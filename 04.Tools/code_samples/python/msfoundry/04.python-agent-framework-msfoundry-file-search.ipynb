    "# 🔍 Agentic RAG with Azure AI Foundry (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using the Microsoft Agent Framework with Azure AI Foundry. You'll learn to create agents that can search through documents and provide accurate, grounded responses based on uploaded content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key RAG Capabilities You'll Build:**\n",
    "- 📚 **Document Upload**: Upload and process documents for agent access\n",
    "- 🔍 **Vector Store Creation**: Create searchable vector stores for semantic retrieval\n",
    "- 🤖 **Grounded Responses**: Build agents that only answer from document content\n",
    "- 🛡️ **Source Attribution**: Ensure responses are traceable to source documents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 RAG Architecture Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core RAG Components\n",
    "- **Document Processing**: Upload files to Azure AI Foundry for indexing\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: Semantic search capability for relevant content retrieval\n",
    "- **File Search Tool**: Agent tool that queries the vector store\n",
    "- **Grounded Generation**: AI responses based only on retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Flow\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Document Upload → Vector Store Creation → Agent Configuration\n",
    "                        ↓                       ↓\n",
    "User Query → File Search Tool → Retrieved Context → Grounded Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Technical Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure AI Foundry Integration\n",
    "- **AIProjectClient**: Manages Azure AI project resources and operations\n",
    "- **AzureAIAgentClient**: Provides agent functionality with Azure backend\n",
    "- **Vector Store Management**: Handles document indexing and retrieval\n",
    "- **File Search Tool**: Built-in tool for semantic document search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Behavior\n",
    "- Only answers questions using information from uploaded documents\n",
    "- Clearly indicates when questions cannot be answered from available content\n",
    "- Provides explicit citations to source documents\n",
    "- Avoids general knowledge responses outside document scope\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup\n",

      "# Agent: GraphRAG is an AI-based content interpretation and search system that uses large language models (LLMs) to parse data and create a knowledge graph. It enables answering user questions about a private dataset by connecting information across many documents, going beyond traditional keyword or vector-based search methods. It can answer complex and thematic questions, such as identifying top themes within a dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "GraphRAG is designed for critical information discovery and analysis where relevant information is spread across noisy or mixed-quality data, or when the questions are abstract. It requires users who are trained in responsible analytic approaches and critical reasoning to verify and augment its responses. It is intended to be used with a specific domain corpus of text data, and users should be mindful of the privacy policies of the underlying LLMs used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system has been evaluated on factors like accurate representation of datasets, transparency of responses, resilience to injection attacks, and low hallucination rates. Limitations include dependency on good indexing examples and the expense of indexing operations. GraphRAG works best with entity-rich, topic-focused natural language text data. Proper human oversight is essential to ensure reliability and appropriate use.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, GraphRAG is a sophisticated AI tool that builds knowledge graphs from data to support deep, multi-document querying and thematic analysis, with an emphasis on responsible use and trust in domain expertise for interpreting its output.\n"

    "## 🚀 Create and Run the RAG Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell performs the complete RAG workflow with modern best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Upload Document**: Upload the document file to Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "2. **Create Vector Store**: Build a searchable vector index from the document\n",
    "3. **Configure File Search Tool**: Set up the tool with the vector store reference\n",
    "4. **Create Agent**: Use `AzureAIProjectAgentProvider` for simplified agent creation\n",
    "5. **Query Agent**: Run the query and get grounded responses\n",
    "6. **Cleanup Resources**: Automatically delete vector store and file to prevent resource leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Improvements:**\n",
    "- Uses `AzureAIProjectAgentProvider` for cleaner agent creation\n",
    "- Uses `AgentsClient` for direct file and vector store operations\n",
    "- Implements proper resource cleanup in `finally` block\n",
    "- Simpler API with `agent.run()` instead of streaming\n",
    "- Better error handling and resource management"
