      "User: What is Microsoft Agent Framework?\n",
      "MyLearnDocsAgent: Microsoft Agent Framework is an open-source, production-ready framework designed for building agentic AI applications with advanced orchestration capabilities. It is built on the Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions package and provides concrete implementations of IChatClient for various AI services such as OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Foundry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key features of Microsoft Agent Framework include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Multi-agent orchestration: Supports multiple orchestration patterns such as sequential, concurrent, group chat, handoff, and magentic (where a lead agent directs other agents).\n",
      "2. Cloud and provider flexibility: It is cloud-agnostic and provider-agnostic, supporting deployment in containers, on-premises, or multi-cloud environments using plugin and connector models.\n",
      "3. Enterprise-grade features: Includes built-in observability with OpenTelemetry, security integration with Microsoft Entra, and responsible AI features like prompt injection protection and task adherence monitoring.\n",
      "4. Standards-based interoperability: Integrates open standards like Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent discovery and tool interaction.\n",
      "5. Supports creating simple agents based on various inference services with function calling, multi-turn conversations, custom tools, and structured output.\n",
      "6. Allows building complex custom agents providing full control over agent behavior and capabilities.\n",
      "7. Supports intelligent automation workflows blending AI agents with business processes with type safety, flexible control flow, external integration, checkpointing, and multi-agent orchestration.\n",
      "\n",
      "For .NET applications, it is the recommended approach to building agentic AI systems with enterprise-grade security and observability.\n",
