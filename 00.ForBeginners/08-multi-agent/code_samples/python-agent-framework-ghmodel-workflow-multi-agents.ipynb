    "\n",
    "### Multi-Agent Process Flow\n",
    "```python\n",
    "User Request → Agent 1 (Specialist) → Agent 2 (Reviewer) → Quality Check\n",
    "                ↓                      ↓                    ↓\n",
    "         Initial Solution → Review & Feedback → Refined Output → Final Result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
