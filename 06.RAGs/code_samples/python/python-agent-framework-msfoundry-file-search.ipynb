    "# 🔍 Agentic RAG with Azure AI Foundry (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using the Microsoft Agent Framework with Azure AI Foundry. You'll learn to create agents that can search through documents and provide accurate, grounded responses based on uploaded content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key RAG Capabilities You'll Build:**\n",
    "- 📚 **Document Upload**: Upload and process documents for agent access\n",
    "- 🔍 **Vector Store Creation**: Create searchable vector stores for semantic retrieval\n",
    "- 🤖 **Grounded Responses**: Build agents that only answer from document content\n",
    "- 🛡️ **Source Attribution**: Ensure responses are traceable to source documents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 RAG Architecture Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core RAG Components\n",
    "- **Document Processing**: Upload files to Azure AI Foundry for indexing\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: Semantic search capability for relevant content retrieval\n",
    "- **File Search Tool**: Agent tool that queries the vector store\n",
    "- **Grounded Generation**: AI responses based only on retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Flow\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Document Upload → Vector Store Creation → Agent Configuration\n",
    "                        ↓                       ↓\n",
    "User Query → File Search Tool → Retrieved Context → Grounded Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Technical Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure AI Foundry Integration\n",
    "- **AIProjectClient**: Manages Azure AI project resources and operations\n",
    "- **AzureAIAgentClient**: Provides agent functionality with Azure backend\n",
    "- **Vector Store Management**: Handles document indexing and retrieval\n",
    "- **File Search Tool**: Built-in tool for semantic document search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Behavior\n",
    "- Only answers questions using information from uploaded documents\n",
    "- Clearly indicates when questions cannot be answered from available content\n",
    "- Provides explicit citations to source documents\n",
    "- Avoids general knowledge responses outside document scope\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup\n",

      "# Agent: GraphRAG is an AI-based content interpretation and search capability. It uses large language models (LLMs) to parse data, create a knowledge graph, and answer user questions about a user-provided private dataset. GraphRAG connects information across large volumes of data and leverages these connections to answer questions that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional keyword or vector-based search methods. It supports queries where answers span multiple documents or where thematic insights, such as top themes in a dataset, are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "GraphRAG is intended for use in critical information discovery and analysis scenarios, especially where data may be noisy, contain misinformation, or where questions are abstract or thematic. It is designed for users experienced in responsible analytic methods and critical reasoning, with the expectation that human domain experts will verify and augment its outputs. It is typically deployed with domain-specific text corpora and does not collect user data itself, though users should verify the privacy of the LLM they configure it with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system has been evaluated for accurate dataset representation, transparency and groundedness of responses, resilience to prompt and data injection attacks, and low hallucination rates. It does require well-constructed indexing based on domain-specific concepts for effective performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "GraphRAG is suitable for use by trusted, domain-savvy users who are working through complex information challenges, and it works best on entity-rich, thematically cohesive natural language text data. Proper human analysis of its responses is critical to ensure reliability, and output safety filters or mitigations may be necessary depending on deployment context.\n",

    "## 🚀 Create and Run the RAG Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell performs the complete RAG workflow with modern best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Upload Document**: Upload the document file to Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "2. **Create Vector Store**: Build a searchable vector index from the document\n",
    "3. **Configure File Search Tool**: Set up the tool with the vector store reference\n",
    "4. **Create Agent**: Use `AzureAIProjectAgentProvider` for simplified agent creation\n",
    "5. **Query Agent**: Run the query and get grounded responses\n",
    "6. **Cleanup Resources**: Automatically delete vector store and file to prevent resource leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Improvements:**\n",
    "- Uses `AzureAIProjectAgentProvider` for cleaner agent creation\n",
    "- Uses `AgentsClient` for direct file and vector store operations\n",
    "- Implements proper resource cleanup in `finally` block\n",
    "- Simpler API with `agent.run()` instead of streaming\n",
    "- Better error handling and resource management"
