# Ignite Demo Script: Product Genius

## 1. Executive Talking Point

"Agents can leverage multimodal models and avatars to create highly personalized customer experiences, while ensuring the human user always remains in control."

## 2. Customer Demo Flow

This demonstration illustrates a seamless, agent-assisted retail experience.

**Scenario Start:** A customer enters a store, but the sales associate is currently busy assisting someone else.

**Virtual Agent Interaction:** The new customer uses their phone to scan a QR code, which instantly launches a virtual "Product Genius" agent.

**Personalization:** The agent asks, "How can I help you today?" and offers to provide personalized recommendations if the customer logs in with their GitHub profile.

**Data-Driven Recommendation:** After the customer consents and logs in, the agent analyzes their commit history and recommends a Python-themed shirt.

**Effortless Checkout:** The customer purchases the recommended product directly through the agent using Apple Pay and is free to leave the store.

**Customization Offer:** As a final touch, the agent offers to help the customer design a custom t-shirt featuring their favorite technologies.

## 3. Key Features for Builders

This entire experience is built using a powerful and integrated set of tools designed for developers.

Customizable Voice-Enabled Avatars: Begin creating your own voice-enabled, live API-driven avatars directly within the agent playground. These avatars are fully customizable.

**Knowledge-Grounded Agents:** Use the agent framework to build a "customer knowledge agent" that is grounded in your own data, such as product information stored in SharePoint documents.

**Secure Data Integration:** Customer information can be dynamically pulled from APIs like the GitHub Store API. Our framework uses On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication, ensuring your agent can only access the user's data within the context of that specific chat session, with full user consent.

**Zero-Code Managed Authentication:** There is no need to write complex authentication code. The platform handles the entire authentication flow for you.

**Seamless Frontend Integration:** We provide a production-ready, prebuilt web chat component that is easy to integrate and customize. Simply add it to your JavaScript code and point it to your agent service for a seamless, connected experience.

**Standard Agent Protocol:** The frontend communicates with your agents using a standard messaging protocol, ensuring reliable and consistent interaction.
